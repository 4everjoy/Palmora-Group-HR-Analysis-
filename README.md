#### Case Study 2 :  A Company in Nigeria embroiled in issues  bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.  As a data analyst, analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management  team would need to address  this issue  using appropriate charts ,  “Now, the  future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” .
##### Question 1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments.
##### Question 2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
##### Question 3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management 
##### Question 4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 

● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 

● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.? 

● Also visualize this by regions

##### Question 5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to: 
●  Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
●  Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus) 
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

##### Step:
* Cleaning of Data
* Assigning generic gender for employees with missing or undisclossed gender represented with unknown.
* Employee with no salary is filter
* Rows with null department was removed.
  This is done to ensure only active employee with valid department information.
 * Stacked column was used for the Gender Distribution by Region and Department.
 *  A Donut chart was used to visualize the performance rating by Gender. 


### FINDINGS:
* Based on the analysis the gender distribution distilled to department and region shows Kaduna has the hihgest gender having 182 Male, Female 165 and the Unknown gender as 14, making a total of 361. There is a skewed male-female ratio in certain region and department which needs to be looked into by Palmoria Group of Company.
* The Insight on rating based on gender was displayed using a Donut chart. This shows male has the highest rating of population with with 49.15% and 465 total of the population, Female 46.62% with a total of 441 and the Unknown gender with a total of 40 which amount to 4.23% of the total population. As a result this signal bias.
* It is observed that there is a gender gap showing the male earn higher above 20m with a total of 35m. This maybe due to the nature of the job done or other circumstances while the female earn lower with a total salary structure of 32m. The unkown gender earn the least showing below 20m.
  
* It also depict the region to be focus on. Gender imbalance in some region and department. This is shown in the salary by department, gender and location table revealing that Lagos State and Human Resources department is needed to be focus on.

### Recommendation
* Equal Pay Adjustments: Create target pay equity adjustment.
* Gender Balance Initiatives: Gender equality rule should be adopted to reduce payment bias. And the ratio of male to female workers should be distributed equaly accross the region and department of the company.
*  Implement adjustment to bring all salaries above the threshold.
*  Anual Monitoring: Implement Quaterly HR analytics reviews to track improvement.

### Conclusion 
 Based on the findings it is clear that there are gaps in the payment rating between gender in each region and department. This should be catered for to ensure equality in pay and gender balance initiative across the department and region.
